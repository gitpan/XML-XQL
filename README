			Perl module:: XML::XQL

Copyright (c) 1998 Enno Derksen
All rights reserved.
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the same terms as Perl itself. 

This is a Perl extension that allows you to perform XQL queries on XML
object trees. Currently only the XML::DOM module is supported, but
other implementations, like XML::Grove, may soon follow.

The web page you found this on is at http://www.erols.com/enno/xql

See the XML::XQL and XML::XQL::Tutorial man pages that come with this 
distribution. (XML::XQL comes as POD documentation at the end of XQL.pm, the
tutorial is in XQL/Tutorial.pod.) See the XQL specification for more details,
it's at: http://www.w3.org/TandS/QL/QL98/pp/xql.html
Look at the test cases in the 't' directory for examples.

Check out xql.pl, which is a nice command line utility for performing XQL 
queries on XML documents and formatting the results in several ways.

XML::XQL needs the following modules to be installed: XML::DOM, XML::Parser,
Parse::Yapp and Date::Manip. All can be found at CPAN.

XML::DOM is an extension to XML::Parser. It adds a new 'Style' to XML::Parser,
called 'Dom', that allows XML::Parser to build an Object Oriented datastructure 
with a DOM Level 1 compliant interface. 
It can also be found at http://www.erols.com/enno/dom.
For a description of the DOM (Document Object Model), see http://www.w3.org/DOM/

XML::Parser is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl and can be found at CPAN.

This is an alpha version and major API changes may occur as I get feedback
from the people on the perl-xml mailing list. [You can subscribe to
this list by sending a message to subscribe-perl-xml@lyris.activestate.com.]

See the To-do list at the top of XQL.pm for all open issues. 
Any suggestions or comments are welcome, the sooner these 
implementation issues are resolved, the faster we can all use this module.
If you find a bug, you would do me great favor by sending it to me in the
form of a test case. See the file t/template.t that comes with this distribution.

For bug reports or suggestions send email to enno@att.com.

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following.

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install XML::Parser somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

You can then test the module by typing:

	make test

If you have write access to the perl library directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install
