============= XML::XQL =========================================================

This is a Perl extension that allows you to perform XQL queries on XML
object trees. Currently only the XML::DOM module is supported, but
other implementations, like XML::Grove, may soon follow.

See the XML::XQL and XML::XQL::Tutorial man pages that come with this 
distribution. See the XQL specification for more details,
it's at: http://www.w3.org/TandS/QL/QL98/pp/xql.html
Look at the test cases in the 't' directory for examples.

Check out xql.pl, which is a nice command line utility for performing XQL 
queries on XML documents and formatting the results in several ways.

XML::XQL needs the following modules to be installed: XML::DOM, XML::Parser,
Parse::Yapp (I use 0.16) and Date::Manip (I use 5.33). All can be found at CPAN.

See the To-do list at the top of XQL.pm for all open issues.
